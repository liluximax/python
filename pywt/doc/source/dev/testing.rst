Continous integration with Travis-CI
------------------------------------

The project is using `Travis-CI <https://travis-ci.org/PyWavelets/pywt>`_ service
for continous integration and testing.

Current build status is:

    :target: https://secure.travis-ci.org/PyWavelets/pywt

If you are submitting a patch or pull request please make sure it
does not break the build.


Running tests locally
---------------------

Tests are implemented with `nose`_, so use one of:

    $ nosetests pywt

    >>> pywt.test()  # doctest: +SKIP

Note doctests require `Matplotlib`_ in addition to the usual dependencies.


Running tests with Tox
----------------------

There's also a config file for running tests with `Tox`_ (``pip install tox``).
To for example run tests for Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 use::

  tox -e py27,py34

For more information see the `Tox`_ documentation.
